        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>

        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Preheat oven to 150°C. Heat half the oil in a large ovenproof casserole pan over high heat. Add half the lamb and cook, turning, for 5 mins or until golden brown. Transfer to a heatproof bowl. Repeat with remaining lamb.</p>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Heat half the remaining oil in the pan. Add half the onion, celery and carrot and cook, stirring, for 5 mins or until vegetables are just tender. Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 min or until aromatic. Return the lamb to the pan with the rosemary, thyme, chicken stock and tomatoes. Bring to the boil. Season. Remove from heat.</p>

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Bake, covered, for 11/2-2 hours or until lamb is very tender. Set aside to cool slightly. Use 2 forks to coarsely shred the lamb.</p>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, place the potato in a large saucepan and cover with cold water. Place over high heat and bring to the boil. Cook for 15 mins or until potato is tender. Drain well. Set aside for 2-3 mins to steam. Return to the pan with the butter. Use a potato masher or fork to mash until smooth. Add the milk and stir to combine. Season well. Cover to keep warm.</p>

        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Heat the remaining oil in a medium frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the remaining onion, celery and carrot and cook, stirring for 5 mins or until tender. Add to the lamb mixture with the peas and stir to combine. Season.</p>

        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Increase oven to 180°C. Spoon mashed potato over the lamb mixture. Bake for 30 mins or until the top is golden brown and mixture is heated through. Serve with mixed salad leaves.</p>
